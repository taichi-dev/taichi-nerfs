## Train a deployable NGP model
Typically, you need a Windows/Linux machine with Nvidia GPUs to train the model.

1. **[Win/Linux]** Install Taichi nightly:
  * `python3 -m pip install -i https://pypi.taichi.graphics/simple/ taichi-nightly==1.7.0.post20230524`

It is strongly adviced that you install taichi-nightly versioned `1.7.0.post20230524` since it's in sync with the pre-compiled C-API library shipped in `taichi_c_api_ios_post20230524.zip` or `c_api`. If you'd like to use your customized taichi version, then please recompile C-API library and replace the `c_api` folder accordingly.

2. **[Win/Linux]** Train a deployable model
  * Go to the root directory of this repository
  * Modify `scripts/train_nsvf_deploy.sh` as you like
  * Start training process with: `./scripts/train_nsvf_deploy.sh`

A pickle file named `deployment.npy` will be generated by the end of the training process.

3. **[Win/Linux]** Generate AOT files with `--model_path`:
  * Feel free to adjust the resolutions with `--res_w` and `res_h`
`python3 taichi_ngp/taichi_ngp.py --aot --model_path={PATH_TO_DEPLOYMENT_MODEL}/deployment.npy --res_w=300 --res_h=600`

Now you should have obtained the neccessary AOT files at `taichi_ngp/compiled` to deploy on mobile devices
